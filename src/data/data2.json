A lot of my work has been white label with a very strict \"if you leave the office with our files we WILL find you\" policy, so please excuse me if \"the process\" isn't as well documented as I'd like. Not to toot my own horn, but until 2020, work was pretty steady, and the idea that I would need to keep my work for a portfolio was a very naive non-consideration. Hindsight! Am I right?"
